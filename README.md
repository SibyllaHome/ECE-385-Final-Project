# ECE-385-Final-Project
System Verilog code to create a simplistic side scrolling, coin collecting mario-styled game for ECE 385 at UIUC

The point of the game is to help Neil collect ECE385 mastery (There were 9 labs, therefore, 9 coins) and ECE 385 final project difficulty points (10 points possible). One of the coins, the 4th one, is red, as it symbolizes the change from TTL logic to System verilog and is a "powerup" in Neil's 385 ability. At the end, he hits the A+ because thats what Neil wants on the Final project but doesn't receive, so he has to hope for help from the Curve gods!

The game is displayed over VGA; all of the games physics and graphics are determined in hardware. 

I have included both my initial proposal and final lab report; for an understanding of how the game (its physics, graphics, etc,) work, the final lab report provides comprehensive diagrams and explanations. 

Originally the plan was to make something much closer to sonic; however about halfway through the project we pivoted it to become something more akin to a platformer.
